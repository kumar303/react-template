# React template

This is a starter template for writing ES2015 React and Redux.
By the time you read this everything will probably be outdated and broken.

## Installation

You'll need Node JS for build management. Install and compile the assets:

    npm install
    grunt watch-static

Open `public/index.html` in a browser.

## Developing With The Hot Reloader

The hot reloading server will make changes appear instantly on the page as you
edit React component code. It's pretty hot! Run it like this:

    grunt serve

Open:

    http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
